# Fill deposit slips

This is a simple browser extensions to fill deposit slips. My accountant sends me a text file every month with the details of the deposits I have to make. I used to copy and paste the data into my bank's website, but I got tired of it and decided to automate the process.

To make the work even more fun, I have decided to do part of the text file processing in Go using [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/).
